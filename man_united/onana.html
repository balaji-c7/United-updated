        andre is a ball playing goal keeper who is in my opinion is great when
        he is used in a advanced role like playing him in possession as a center
        back like position along side another one for example this season he is
        played along side johnny evans.. he excels at being a player who absorbs
        oppositions pressure and playing through the lines(the passes)
